## *About me*

## *My solution to the task on Codewars:*

<details>
	<summary>DESCRIPTION(copied from the task):</summary>
  Create a function or callable object that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers. The function should also return "Even" or "Odd" when accessing a value at an integer index.
</details>

```ruby
def EvenOrOdd(int)
  if int%2 == 0 
    "Even"
  else
    "Odd"
  end
end

class EvenOrOdd
  def self.[](int)
    value = int
    EvenOrOdd(value)
  end
end

EvenOrOdd(1) # => "Odd"
EvenOrOdd[1] # => "Odd"

EvenOrOdd(2) # => "Even"
EvenOrOdd[2] # => "Even"
```
